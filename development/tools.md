# Tools 
In order to develop on reactory you will require the following tools on your local machine

## IDE
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the IDE of choice, but since all tasks are run from the shell any text editor will work.

## Mongo DB
The core server makes use of [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) for data storage. Follow the MongoDB setup found on the server install for more details.

## Node JS
You will require [Node.js 16.x](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the reactory platform. It is advised that you use nvm as you node version manager.
