# Object Mapping

An important concept to understand in Reactory is object mapping.

## Current.

## Roadmap
Intelligent mapping based on props inspection. If properties passed to an object looks like a property map based on inspection, the reactory engine will automatically suggest mappings between objects / components during designtime. The goal is to create an object mapping engine that can inspect all schemas within the system and and be able to determine potential maps when building forms / components.
