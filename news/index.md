# Open Sourcing Reactory - A Tried and Tested Platform for Building Web Apps

Hello everyone, 

I am Werner Weber, the architect, primary engineer and owner of the Reactory platform. I am pleased to announce that we are open sourcing Reactory to the community. 

After years of building and testing, we are confident that Reactory is a simple, reliable and proven tool that can help developers and businesses of all sizes build web apps quickly and easily. Our platform is built to be flexible, extensible and easy to use, making it a perfect fit for both small and large teams alike.

With the release of Reactory v1 as an open source project, we are hoping to collaborate with other engineers and companies to build a strong and vibrant community around the platform. Our goal is to continue to innovate and build on top of the platform, making it even better over time.

We encourage developers of all skill levels to try out Reactory and contribute to its development. Whether you are a seasoned engineer or just starting out, we believe that Reactory has something to offer everyone.

Thank you for your support and we look forward to collaborating with you.

Best regards,
Werner Weber
