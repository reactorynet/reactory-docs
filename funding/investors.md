# Reactory Investor Relations

Dear potential angel investor,

Thank you for your interest in Reactory. We are excited to share with you the potential of our open source platform and the opportunities it presents for growth and profitability.

Reactory is a low-risk investment opportunity as we have already generated profit from some of the apps built on our platform. We are also planning a SaaS offering that will be largely automated using Reactory.

Reactory has been built by Werner Weber and several contributing engineers over the past 5 years both full time and part time. We are looking to collaborate with other engineers and companies to expand our open source platform and provide a simple, tried and tested tool for the B2B, B2C, and C2C markets.

Our team includes an experienced architect and designer who has a proven track record in payment settlement integrations in the past using SWIFT protocols as well as custom banking processes. Please see our products page for a list of products we are building and plan to build.

We are open to discussing investment opportunities with interested parties. Please contact us at werner.weber@reactory.net to discuss further. Please note all IP is owned by Werner Weber. Mr. Weber is currently full time employed as Principal Engineer with a fintech organization and Reactory is currently a part-time project. Any investments at this stage would be set towards setting up a non-profit organization for the core product IP and setting up a brain trust and engineering council to steer the open source efforts.

Thank you for considering Reactory as an investment opportunity.

Sincerely,

Werner Weber and the Reactory Team
