Having the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) documented in your source code repository is highly beneficial for open-source projects for several reasons:

### Transparency and Clarity
1. **Transparency**: Clearly outlines the project's development process, making it easier for contributors to understand how the project is managed and developed.
2. **Expectations Management**: Sets clear expectations for new contributors regarding how the project operates and progresses through different stages.

### Onboarding and Contribution
3. **Onboarding**: Provides new contributors with a comprehensive guide to the project's lifecycle, helping them get up to speed quickly.
4. **Contribution Guidelines**: Offers a clear structure for how and when contributions can be made, enhancing the quality and coherence of contributions.

### Collaboration and Communication
5. **Improved Collaboration**: Facilitates better collaboration among distributed teams by providing a unified understanding of the project's workflow.
6. **Effective Communication**: Ensures that all contributors, regardless of location, have access to the same information, reducing miscommunications and misunderstandings.

### Project Management
7. **Organized Development**: Helps maintain an organized approach to development, ensuring that all stages from planning to deployment are documented and followed.
8. **Tracking Progress**: Allows for easy tracking of the project’s progress through its lifecycle, aiding in project management and planning.

### Quality Assurance
9. **Consistency**: Promotes consistency in how the project is developed and maintained, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.
10. **Quality Control**: Helps enforce best practices and standards throughout the development process, leading to higher quality code and documentation.

### Community and Engagement
11. **Community Trust**: Builds trust within the community by showing that the project follows a structured and professional development process.
12. **Increased Engagement**: Encourages more active participation from the community by making the project more approachable and easier to contribute to.

### Knowledge Sharing
13. **Documentation as a Resource**: Serves as a valuable resource for both current and future contributors, preserving knowledge about the project’s processes and decisions.
14. **Educational Value**: Provides educational value to contributors who can learn about SDLC practices and how they are applied in real-world projects.

### Compliance and Standards
15. **Standards Compliance**: Ensures that the project adheres to industry standards and best practices, which can be important for compliance and integration with other systems.
16. **Auditability**: Facilitates audits and reviews by providing a clear documentation of the project’s development process.
