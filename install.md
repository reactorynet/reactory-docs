# Installation Guide
Depending on your development use case, you might only need to work on the front end or backend related projects.  In most cases developers will likely use both the client and server in their development task.

We suggest you start with the installation of the [reactory-express-server](https://github.com/reactorynet/reactory-express-server).
After that install the the [reactory-client](https://github.com/reactorynet/reactory-pwa-web-client).

Each of thesehas detailed instructions on how to get to install and use these.
