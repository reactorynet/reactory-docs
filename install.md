# Installation Guide
Depending on your development use case, you might only need to work on the front end or backend related projects.  In most cases developers will likely use both the client and server in their development task.

We suggest you start with the installation of the [reactory-express-server](https://github.com/reactorynet/reactory-express-server).
After that install the the [reactory-client](https://github.com/reactorynet/reactory-pwa-web-client).

Each of these have detailed instructions on how to install and use them.

Additional plugins and modules can be built and are provided by 3rd parties. These are also covered in more detail within the server and client projects.
